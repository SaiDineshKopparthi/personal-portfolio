            <h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
            <p>
                I am a recent Master's graduate in Applied Computer Science from Northwest Missouri State University,
                driven by an unending enthusiasm for learning and a passion for advancing in the field of computer
                science.

                solutions.
                My roles have ranged from enhancing user interfaces and integrating third-party applications to
                supporting educational initiatives and contributing to Agile transformations.

            <p>
                My career is marked by a commitment to staying at the forefront of technology and achieving excellence
                in every project I undertake.
                I am dedicated to exploring new technologies and leveraging my skills to drive impactful results.
                My diverse experience, from developing dynamic web components to optimizing geospatial data systems,
                reflects my goal of pushing the boundaries of what's possible in computer science.
